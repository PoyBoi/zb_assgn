The setup process allows you to add resources to the project and upload related ZIP files, PDFs, images or enter a URL. You can add project plan documents, project scope specifications, design assets etc. as resources. 🧩 Option 1: Use a Custom Project Template zipBoard’s Custom Project Templates help you save time by preloading your project with relevant settings and tools for your specific industry. These templates automatically customize your project interface, so you don’t have to start from scratch. Available Templates: 🏗️ Construction Template – for document reviews in construction 🎨 Web Design Template – for design and QA feedback 🎓 Learning Design Template – for eLearning content reviews ✍️ Content Development Template – for editorial and content collaboration During project creation, simply select your preferred template from the list — and you're ready to go. 🛠️ Option 2: Build Your Project from Scratch If you’d rather start fresh and customize everything yourself, follow these steps: 1. Log in to your zipBoard account. This directs you to your zipBoard account dashboard or explorer. In case you are already logged in, click on the zipBoard logo in the upper left corner. It directs you to the account dashboard. 2. Select ‘Start from Scratch’. This opens the ‘New Project’ dialogue box. 3. Set up your project : Enter a name for your project. Optionally, edit the project ID or use the default. Add a project description. Skip the template selection if you want to build from scratch. 4. Click ‘Save’ to create the project. 5. Next, you will see the option to ‘ Invite Your Team ’. You can choose to invite team members by entering their email ID or zipBoard username, or you can do this later and skip the step. 6. You will now get the option to add files or a URL to your project. You can choose to enter a URL or upload a ZIP file, PDF, audio, or image. You can upload HTML prototypes or SCORM content by selecting the ZIP file option. For image files, you can upload JPEG and PNG images. 7. Next, you will have the option to add a task (optional): Create a bug, feature request, enhancement, or general task. Assign it, set priority, and attach files. Or add tasks later. After the task has been added, you will see this screen. This is where you can modify and control the task . 🎉 That’s it — your project is ready! Whether you used a template or built it from scratch, you can now continue collaborating with your team in zipBoard. 👉 Up next: Learn about the zipBoard account dashboard.

The setup process allows you to add resources to the project and upload related ZIP files, PDFs, images or enter a URL. You can add project plan documents, project scope specifications, design assets etc. as resources. 🧩 Option 1: Use a Custom Project Template zipBoard’s Custom Project Templates help you save time by preloading your project with relevant settings and tools for your specific industry. These templates automatically customize your project interface, so you don’t have to start from scratch. Available Templates: 🏗️ Construction Template – for document reviews in construction 🎨 Web Design Template – for design and QA feedback 🎓 Learning Design Template – for eLearning content reviews ✍️ Content Development Template – for editorial and content collaboration During project creation, simply select your preferred template from the list — and you're ready to go. 🛠️ Option 2: Build Your Project from Scratch If you’d rather start fresh and customize everything yourself, follow these steps: 1. Log in to your zipBoard account. This directs you to your zipBoard account dashboard or explorer. In case you are already logged in, click on the zipBoard logo in the upper left corner. It directs you to the account dashboard. 2. Select ‘Start from Scratch’. This opens the ‘New Project’ dialogue box. 3. Set up your project : Enter a name for your project. Optionally, edit the project ID or use the default. Add a project description. Skip the template selection if you want to build from scratch. 4. Click ‘Save’ to create the project. 5. Next, you will see the option to ‘ Invite Your Team ’. You can choose to invite team members by entering their email ID or zipBoard username, or you can do this later and skip the step. 6. You will now get the option to add files or a URL to your project. You can choose to enter a URL or upload a ZIP file, PDF, audio, or image. You can upload HTML prototypes or SCORM content by selecting the ZIP file option. For image files, you can upload JPEG and PNG images. 7. Next, you will have the option to add a task (optional): Create a bug, feature request, enhancement, or general task. Assign it, set priority, and attach files. Or add tasks later. After the task has been added, you will see this screen. This is where you can modify and control the task . 🎉 That’s it — your project is ready! Whether you used a template or built it from scratch, you can now continue collaborating with your team in zipBoard. 👉 Up next: Learn about the zipBoard account dashboard.

Edit, delete and download options are available at the top right corner of the review panel (#2). The file/link content is launched when you click the ‘Review’ button (#3). The date and person who added the file or link is displayed in the lower-left corner of the Review panel (#4). The 'Share' button enables you to generate a custom link that can be shared with others to get feedback from external reviewers (#5). As the project life cycle progresses and issues are reported, there could be numerous screen captures as issues are identified. The bottom table of the Review panel keeps a running tab for the number of screens captured, and the number of tasks and comments added (#6). Tasks All bugs, issues, feature requests, enhancements, or communication that needs to be tracked can be added as a comment in projects. Tasks can be associated with either a file or just the overall project. Tasks can be created by all collaborators on a project. They can be used as implementation reminders, emphasize a process to be followed, or document style or format requirements from the client style guide. Selecting Tasks from the project menu bar displays the project task manager where you can: View and access all the tasks added to the project. Filter the tasks table according to phases, files, reporter, assignee, priority, status, type or screen resolution. Sort the tasks table either according to the creation/update date or in an alphabetical manner. By default, the last created task appears at the top of the task manager. Search a task by entering task title, keywords or any of the other task properties. Add a new generic task to the project. External Feedback The comment is a part of project communication that does not need to be tracked as tasks. They are accessible by clicking on the ‘External Feedback’ tab in the menu bar on the left. Comments are especially useful for collecting reviews and comments from external reviewers and collaborators. All comments gathered from the custom share link is displayed in the ‘Comment’ section. This Comments can always be converted to tasks if needed. However, it cannot be converted back to comment. Selecting to add a comment opens a basic dialog panel similar to a Task modal. The information added to the text field, however, is the full content of the comment. Unlike tasks, comments do not have a title field. can also tag someone using the @name format. Anyone related to the project can view and respond to feedback. Running communication within comments can be easily followed as well. As replies are entered, the comment summary shows that there is an ongoing thread. Phases Project progression across different stages or milestones can be identified by defining different phases in your project. Selecting the Phase option from the project menu bar enables you to set up such a phase for your project. To set up project phases, follow these steps: 1. Open the project. 2. Select the ‘Phases’ option from the project menu that appears on the left. 3. Click on the ‘Add Phase’ button. Enter the phase name, description, status, and estimated completion date. Click on the ‘Add’ button. Once you have set up a phase, you can directly add files, tasks, and comments to it. You can also assign existing files and tasks to a phase by modifying their properties. However, you cannot assign existing comments to a phase. Captures All screenshots taken when reviewing a file can be seen in the ‘Images/videos’ section. Each screen card displays a thumbnail image, along with a limited set of property values displayed on the bottom of each card. The property values include the date the screen was captured, who captured it, and the title for the screen. You can search through the screens based on the 'on-screen' title and even can filter them based on who captured the screen and for which file the screen was captured. To quickly review bugs or issues, selecting the “Screens” option allows you to quickly view the slide or section where issues have been noted. Selecting the thumbnail displays the capture and any associated pointers/annotations. Selecting a pointer immediately directs you to the bug or enhancement request.

The Slack communication too is a one-way function from zipBoard to Slack, which means that issues and communication from zipBoard will appear in Slack but not the other way round. On the project properties panel, scroll to the bottom of the panel and select the Add to Slack option. The Slack integration properties panel will be displayed. On the Slack properties panel, select the appropriate channel as the “Post to” location. Select ‘Save’ changes. zipBoard will establish a connection with Slack.

The application captures the following information: Date of change Who made the change A brief description of the change Uploads The “Uploads” section contains all the assets and resources attached to the project. Accessing this section also gives you the option to select a file or link for review. In this section, you can Add a new file/link to the project. Filter through files and links based on their type and phase. Search for project resources across all files based on the file name. Access file/link properties to open, delete or share a particular file or link. Opening any file takes you to the Review Panel ; which shows the following information and options: The file name/link is shown at the top of the Review panel (#1). Edit, delete and download options are available at the top right corner of the review panel (#2). The file/link content is launched when you click the ‘Review’ button (#3). The date and person who added the file or link is displayed in the lower-left corner of the Review panel (#4). The 'Share' button enables you to generate a custom link that can be shared with others to get feedback from external reviewers (#5). As the project life cycle progresses and issues are reported, there could be numerous screen captures as issues are identified. The bottom table of the Review panel keeps a running tab for the number of screens captured, and the number of tasks and comments added (#6). Tasks All bugs, issues, feature requests, enhancements, or communication that needs to be tracked can be added as a comment in projects. Tasks can be associated with either a file or just the overall project. Tasks can be created by all collaborators on a project. They can be used as implementation reminders, emphasize a process to be followed, or document style or format requirements from the client style guide. Selecting Tasks from the project menu bar displays the project task manager where you can: View and access all the tasks added to the project. Filter the tasks table according to phases, files, reporter, assignee, priority, status, type or screen resolution. Sort the tasks table either according to the creation/update date or in an alphabetical manner. By default, the last created task appears at the top of the task manager. Search a task by entering task title, keywords or any of the other task properties. Add a new generic task to the project. External Feedback The comment is a part of project communication that does not need to be tracked as tasks. They are accessible by clicking on the ‘External Feedback’ tab in the menu bar on the left. Comments are especially useful for collecting reviews and comments from external reviewers and collaborators. All comments gathered from the custom share link is displayed in the ‘Comment’ section. This Comments can always be converted to tasks if needed. However, it cannot be converted back to comment. Selecting to add a comment opens a basic dialog panel similar to a Task modal. The information added to the text field, however, is the full content of the comment. Unlike tasks, comments do not have a title field. can also tag someone using the @name format. Anyone related to the project can view and respond to feedback. Running communication within comments can be easily followed as well. As replies are entered, the comment summary shows that there is an ongoing thread. Phases Project progression across different stages or milestones can be identified by defining different phases in your project. Selecting the Phase option from the project menu bar enables you to set up such a phase for your project. To set up project phases, follow these steps: 1. Open the project. 2. Select the ‘Phases’ option from the project menu that appears on the left. 3. Click on the ‘Add Phase’ button. Enter the phase name, description, status, and estimated completion date. Click on the ‘Add’ button. Once you have set up a phase, you can directly add files, tasks, and comments to it. You can also assign existing files and tasks to a phase by modifying their properties. However, you cannot assign existing comments to a phase. Captures All screenshots taken when reviewing a file can be seen in the ‘Images/videos’ section. Each screen card displays a thumbnail image, along with a limited set of property values displayed on the bottom of each card. The property values include the date the screen was captured, who captured it, and the title for the screen. You can search through the screens based on the 'on-screen' title and even can filter them based on who captured the screen and for which file the screen was captured. To quickly review bugs or issues, selecting the “Screens” option allows you to quickly view the slide or section where issues have been noted. Selecting the thumbnail displays the capture and any associated pointers/annotations. Selecting a pointer immediately directs you to the bug or enhancement request. Settings Selecting the settings option from the project menu bar opens an edit setting modal. As a project owner, you can update general project settings at any time during the project life cycle. You can modify the Project ID, Title, and Description, as desired. Select Save to retain any changes; select Cancel to retain existing content. Integrations If you wish to integrate your zipBoard project with your team’s Slack or JIRA account you can do that right from the edit project settings modal. JIRA Integration With JIRA integration, all the tasks that you add to your zipBoard project are automatically reflected in your mapped(selected) JIRA project. zipBoard tasks appear in JIRA. Click on the JIRA icon at the bottom of the project settings modal, to proceed with JIRA integration. Once Jira integration is done, mapping can be done by clicking on the Jira icon. now you need to map the zipBoard project to one of your JIRA projects to continue. A step-by-step guide for this can be found here . Slack Integration The Slack integration allows all team members to view on-going project activity on a Slack channel, which makes tracking things easy. The Slack communication too is a one-way function from zipBoard to Slack, which means that issues and communication from zipBoard will appear in Slack but not the other way round. On the project properties panel, scroll to the bottom of the panel and select the Add to Slack option. The Slack integration properties panel will be displayed. On the Slack properties panel, select the appropriate channel as the “Post to” location. Select ‘Save’ changes. zipBoard will establish a connection with Slack. Setting the integration for a particular project does not impact the integration with other zipBoard projects and Slack. You can see a step-by-step guide here . Did this answer your question?

The aim of the beta phase is to let a small group of the target audience sample the product and collect feedback from their reviews. When the Beta version of your product is ready, then you can easily collate feedback from your beta users using zipBoard. zipBoard environments let you generate a sharable link that you can share with all your Beta users over any communication media of your choice. With this link, users can not only view the BETA file/URL but can also add their feedback, for which they don’t even need to login to zipBoard. To start Beta testing with zipBoard, follow the steps below : Create a new project You can set up your file/URL for beta testing in a fresh project in zipBoard. Login to zipBoard and click the ‘Create New Project’ card on the dashboard. When setting up the project, enter a name for the project. You can choose to edit the default project ID and description. Click the ‘Save’ button to create the project. NOTE: If you have an existing project in zipBoard for your ongoing work, you can skip creating a new project and can directly proceed to step 2.] 2. Add the Beta version URL/file to the zipBoard project. Select the appropriate zipBoard project. From the project dashboard, select Add Files and URLs option. From the options to choose file type, select URL/the appropriate file type. Add the Beta URL/ file along with other details as required. Click ADD button to proceed. 3. Generate the shareable link. Click the options icon corresponding to the URL/file which needs to be reviewed by the Beta users. Select the ‘Share File’ option from the dropdown. From the share file modal, allow for ‘Collaborators/Guest Review’. NOTE: This link enables the users to view the shared URL, click screenshots wherever required and add annotations and comments to specify an issue they are facing. You need not allow for ‘Require Signup/Login’ as this would impose the users with the link with the restriction to log in to the system, in order to review the file. For Beta testing, it’s not recommended. 4. Share the link You can share the generated link via any medium either mail, Slack, Skype… with the beta users. You can copy the obtained link and can share it using any media of your choice or simply email the beta users directly using the interface. For that just add the email ID and your message(If required) and click send. 5. View and analyze the feedback Open the project and select ‘Comments’ from the project menu bar on the left. Review all incoming Feedback Go through all the comments one by one and decide on further action for each one of them. Make the actionable items as tasks Click on the 'Add as task ' corresponding to the comment you need to make a task 2. Click ‘Yes’ to convert. 3.

Guest collaborators when invited to collaborate, need to signup and then they can review the file they are invited to collaborate on. Collaborators within zipBoard are individuals invited directly through the platform using the “add collaborator” button.

Instead, they are directed to the specific file being reviewed via the shared link. This ensures that guest collaborators can provide feedback on the relevant content without accessing the broader project environment.

Managing feedback effectively is essential to ensuring a clutter-free project cycle. At zipBoard, we recognize that while clients don’t need to know the nitty-gritty of your internal workflows, they must be seamlessly integrated into the review and approval process when required.

Collaborators : Internal team members who manage the project's workflows, comments, and activities. Clients : External stakeholders who can access and approve feedback while remaining focused on project deliverables without visibility into internal discussions. Why Do We Have This Feature? Privacy for Internal Teams : Keep internal activities and comments confidential while allowing clients to participate where needed. Streamlined Feedback Process : Clients can review, approve, and convert feedback into actionable, trackable tasks, ensuring smoother collaboration. Clear Roles, No Confusion : By distinguishing between internal and external contributors, everyone stays in sync without compromising team privacy or efficiency. How to Add Clients to Your zipBoard Project Log in to your zipBoard account and navigate to the desired project. On the project home screen, go to the Collaborators tab in the left menu. Click the 'Add Client' button. Enter the email address of your client and an optional invitation message . Click the 'Invite' button to send the invitation.

Go to the Files and URLs section using the side panel 2. Now, in order to upload an image/mock/file/link, you have to click on the ‘ADD’ button. Select the type of file that you wish to review. For this tutorial, we would be using a Website. 3. Give a name and description to your website and add URL and click 'ADD' 4. Voila! Your website has successfully been added! Now in order to share it with your client, collaborator or user, click on the ‘Share’ button. 5. Here you have the option to create custom share links for people to review. You can require them to signup and login to review, let them view all the boards/reviews, or add new boards/reviews. 6. For our scenario, we want to get the feedback from the user without any need to signup/login, so we give them permission to add new boards/reviews. This generates a share link which we will be copying and sending it to our users. 7.

The biggest challenge with remote teams is setting the right systems. We need systems on big teams that can collaborate and produce great content. For the text and presentations, you can work with google docs and slides. But for reviewing the content and getting feedback you need a power-packed solution that has these three main components. Capture stakeholder reviews & feedback Triage the feedback into internal workflow Manage issues and tasks Keeping these major requirements in mind we have designed zipBoard. Before we dive in to show you all the main features of zipBoard. Make sure you have already signed up for the free trial and are logged in to zipBoard. In case you haven't signed up yet please go ahead and Sign up for a free account here and get started . By setting up zipBoard as your main feedback management tool, you are going to speed up your content development process. Step 1 - Create a new project Start by creating a new project. Once you are logged into your account, click on the big plus button to create a new project. Refer to the below preview. Add title, description and there is a custom project id that you use in your workflow then you can use that also. Step 2 - Upload content The next step is to add content for review. zipBoard lets you share quick feedback on working content like webpages, web apps, e-learning courses, PDF documents, images, videos. You can create reviews through the development lifecycle using screenshots and annotated screens. In order to add your content to zipBoard, you can add a webpage URL , a zipped SCORM file ( for e-learning courses), mp4 files ( for videos), image files, PDF documents, and files hosted on cloud storage like dropbox or google docs as links. Content can also be added afterwards while reviewing files or adding comments. You can always add more content by simplifying uploading it with tasks, comments. Here is a more detailed step by step guide of “ How to upload and review SCORM/ Valid HTML content with zipBoard? ” Step 3 - Add Collaborators It's always a great idea to have all team members added as collaborators from the start. These are people who will have full visibility of the project and can be assigned specific tasks to follow up on reviews. You can always add more collaborators or guests at a later stage. However, by adding it in the beginning you can assign tasks or ask for a visual review from your team. Adding collaborators is as easy as you see it below. For more detailed procedures you can even follow the step from this knowledge base article Step 4 - Share files with guests for review and feedback. Getting reviews and feedback from your clients or guests is important. But at the same time, you do not want to overwhelm them with internal tasks and discussions. Basically, all you need is a review from your client or external stakeholders. To do this zipBoard allows adding guest collaborators who can only review and share feedback. For a detailed guide on this r efer to our help doc . For now, here is a quick preview of how you can do it. Step 5 - Turn feedback into Tasks or create new tasks Now you are ready to add and manage visual reviews and tasks. Create tasks based on the feedback so that you can track progress. A good practice is to assign tasks for every feedback that you receive. You can create tasks from the review board, project dashboard area, or even while making a comment on the existing tasks. See how easy it is to create tasks Step 7 - Set Priorities for your Tasks It’s important that you set priorities for your tasks to move quickly with the high priority items. zipBoard offers you a drop-down list of set priorities for you to choose from. Setting priorities makes sure that the collaborators understand the urgency of a particular task and work accordingly. zipBoard automatically adds the date, time, creator, operating system environment, screen size when you are creating the tasks. This way you can even track each task if at all you need to. Step 8 - Assign to Stakeholders Now that the content is visually reviewed and tasks are created, it's time to assign tasks to the person who will be practically working on completing them. Connect with the team and assign tasks to responsible stakeholders and set approx ETA. zipBoard offers adding estimated ETA and real ETA. Using the time tracking feature of zipBoard you can actually monitor the time taken to finish each task and the project as a whole. For you to add stakeholders you will need to have them added as collaborators. If you did not add your collaborator while creating the account. You can add them now. Step 9 - Move tasks in different phases There are three main phases that any project can be categorized into. Backlog Work in Progress Completed Additionally, you can even Future Ideas or anything custom that you can think of. You can create different phases as per your needs and drag the tasks into different phases or choose from the dropdown list. Step 10 - Customize your view For an enhanced experience you can change the view of your dashboard, there are two views to choose from (Table View and Kanban View) Refer to the below screenshot to see how each of these looks. You can switch the views any time by using the toggle button right under the project name. 1. Table View 2. Kanban view Did this answer your question?

Here, we have compiled three comprehensive guides based on your role on zipBoard. 1. The Complete Comprehensive Guide for Owners/Admin : This Guide contains all of the details you need to get started. All the features and ins and outs are described here. It is recommended for Admins/Owners, the individuals who create the projects. 2. The Complete Comprehensive Guide for Collaborators : This Guide is meant for creators who were invited as collaborators, either by link or email, to work on a project. Collaborators can do pretty much everything that Admins/Owners can do, except for a few. 3. The Complete Comprehensive Guide for Guest Reviewers : If you are invited as a guest reviewer/external client/stakeholder, you might want to keep this one handy. It describes everything that an external reviewer is capable of doing. All of the guides are also linked with various help articles. Make sure to check our help documents for further help. If you feel that the guides are missing something or can be improved in any way, or if you need help with something for which articles are not available or adequate, feel free to write to us at support@zipboard.co.

We have also introduced a new “Business Plan” priced at $110/month, when billed annually. Why did the pricing plan change? The Business Plan will allow our new users to collaborate on 50 files/URLs at once and also allow them to add managers to their projects.

Yes , unlike tasks, you can assign one content to multiple collaborators in zipBoard. The latest September update for 2022 now provides our users with a content manager, similar to the one you’ve been using for tasks . This new content manager will ensure that you have a holistic online proofing experience with each content now having its development phase, status, due date, assignee, description, and so on. You get the gist. Now let’s see how you can assign one content to multiple collaborators using this content manager. Assign content to multiple collaborators Simply click on any uploaded content. There you see a dropdown below “ASSIGNED TO” where you can select the collaborator you want to assign the content. Something you can’t even do in the task manager ! You can also check the assignees along with the due date and status info in the content cards while you’re in the Kanban view. Did this answer your question?

But, for webpages and courses, we are dependent on the HTML / coding structure of that webpage. While we have tried to include and test on many different authoring tools, supporting every authoring tool, where the tech does not have the specific APIs exposed, we are unable to get the tagging to work. For comments to work in zipBoard directly on the courses or webpages , zipBoard needs the following information: a unique URL for every page to reflect change in contentor a Webpage to expose an API in global scope to read/set current locatione.g. window.getPageId, window.setPageId ( this information varies for different authoring tools or webpages- and we have had to engineer this to cover as many as cases as possible ) Annotation positioning relies on element IDs and class names. So it’s required for elements to have unique IDs/class names for correct positioning. i.e. if a course changes content of the page without changing URL or exposing JavaScript API for reading location and elements that don't have unique id/class name annotation might appear on top of the wrong element. There are courses authored in some authoring tools, which do not give any of this information, in that case, the users have to resort to taking a screenshot manually and then adding annotations. Status for specific Authoring tools Courses created in the following authoring tools where annotations work directly: Rise ( Articulate ) Adobe Captivate GOMO Courses created in the following authoring tools, do not work with directly tagging annotations, and require screenshots to be taken: Articulate 360 Articulate Storyline Elucidat Adapt Please note, these are the authoring tools that we have tested with, if there are any other specific ones that you would like us to test, feel free to share the content. Requirements for courses to work in zipBoard player: We do not really mandate having any tracking standards for courses to work in zipBoard. But, sometimes, the published course requires them to be enabled for the course to work properly. If the course engine requires any of these standards to finish a course, our player also requires the same.

But, for webpages and courses, we are dependent on the HTML / coding structure of that webpage. While we have tried to include and test on many different authoring tools, supporting every authoring tool, where the tech does not have the specific APIs exposed, we are unable to get the tagging to work. For comments to work in zipBoard directly on the courses or webpages , zipBoard needs the following information: a unique URL for every page to reflect change in contentor a Webpage to expose an API in global scope to read/set current locatione.g. window.getPageId, window.setPageId ( this information varies for different authoring tools or webpages- and we have had to engineer this to cover as many as cases as possible ) Annotation positioning relies on element IDs and class names. So it’s required for elements to have unique IDs/class names for correct positioning. i.e. if a course changes content of the page without changing URL or exposing JavaScript API for reading location and elements that don't have unique id/class name annotation might appear on top of the wrong element. There are courses authored in some authoring tools, which do not give any of this information, in that case, the users have to resort to taking a screenshot manually and then adding annotations. Status for specific Authoring tools Courses created in the following authoring tools where annotations work directly: Rise ( Articulate ) Adobe Captivate GOMO Courses created in the following authoring tools, do not work with directly tagging annotations, and require screenshots to be taken: Articulate 360 Articulate Storyline Elucidat Adapt Please note, these are the authoring tools that we have tested with, if there are any other specific ones that you would like us to test, feel free to share the content. Requirements for courses to work in zipBoard player: We do not really mandate having any tracking standards for courses to work in zipBoard. But, sometimes, the published course requires them to be enabled for the course to work properly. If the course engine requires any of these standards to finish a course, our player also requires the same.

So you've shared a file with your external collaborators but can't remember which permission level you sent to who. There's an easy way to manage the share links all in one place. How to Manage Share Links in zipBoard 1️⃣ Open the Share Links Panel Locate the file you previously shared. In the pop-up, navigate to the ""Share Links"" section in the top menu. In the ""Share Links"" section you will be shown all the various types of share links that you have generated. Each link will be indicative a different combination of permission settings as described through the use of icons: Icon Meaning 🔑 Arrow Through a Door Users must sign up/log in to access the file. 💬 Chat Bubbles Users can add comments and annotations . 👀 Eye Icon Users can view existing comments and annotations . If the icon is in green, that means that it is one of the permissions that have been enabled for the associated share link on the left in the Shared URL section.

At zipBoard, we put a lot of emphasis on asynchronous collaboration , but that does not have to be on spreadsheets and team messages only. You can take your content and document collaboration further with annotations. Leave notes directly on your websites , videos , images , courses , and PDF documents - so that all communication is in-context and everyone stays in sync. This feature is available to all users for many different content types. You will need to download a one-time browser plugin to use the annotation features. Soon, for some content types, you will not need the browser plugin. Here’s a short video explaining the various annotation tools: Adding annotations To start adding annotations to existing content, you first add content to your project . After clicking Review on the content added, you will see the annotation and commenting tools on the left. You can pick any of the tools to start drawing or simply add comments. By default, the annotation tools will be displayed on the left side of your screen. This review bar is easily draggable. You can drag and place it anywhere on your content. Allowing you to review the content with no impediment. The various annotation tools at your disposal Now that we know how you can start your review for a file, let’s talk about all the annotation tools. So, here are the tools that you can use to review your content. A. Comment Let’s talk about the first tool in your arsenal. The comment tool. This is the simplest tool to leave contextual feedback on any content. To use the tool, simply click on the second icon which once hovered over spells, “Comment”. Once you click it, it will turn green which means now you are ready to add comments/feedback on your content using the comment tool. Now click anywhere on the file to add a comment. You’ll notice that there’s a checkbox, “Add as task”. If you untick this, your feedback will simply go in the comment section and will not be added as a task . Although you will have an option to add it as a task later on from within the dashboard. Once you’re ready, simply type your feedback and hit send. zipBoard will record your feedback. With a dot a signify its placement, we’ve found that our users love this the most. But fret not, there are many more tools designed specifically to match our user’s unique use cases. B. Pencil Moving on to our next tool. To use the pencil tool, simply select the third icon, pencil. And as you might have guessed, you can now start using this review tool like a pencil. (I’ve personally found it interesting trying to write one's name with it. But we’re deviating.) Here, we have 2 options in the Pencil, 1. Pencil mode Once you’ve selected the tool, simply click and drag your cursor to draw. The pencil tool can be used to circle, underline or even highlight elements (more on this soon) within the content. After you've drawn, a comment box will appear to add the annotation. Click “Add” to save the annotation on your content. The user can also select the thickness of the pencil from the toolbar 2. Highlight mode(with pencil) When the user wants to highlight some image/text we can use this highlight mode with a pencil, you can also select the thickness of the highlighter C. Highlighter Why use the pencil tool when we have a dedicated annotation tool to highlight content? You’ll find the highlighter just below the pencil tool. Once you’ve selected the tool, you can click and drag on any text on the screen to highlight the section. Release your cursor and a comment box will appear. Simply hit submit and your desired text will be highlighted. Note: The highlighter tool can only be used on text. Sometimes, you need to point your feedback to a specific element. And for this, we have an arrow tool in zipBoard. So, the collaborators never miss your targeted feedback. To use the tool, click on the tool with an arrow. You can then drag your cursor to the object where you want the arrow to point. Release your cursor and a comment box will appear. Add your comment and click on the small green button on the right to save it. E. Rectangle This tool as its name suggests allows you to provide comments on an area of the screen. Some users call it the area tool. To use the rectangle tool, select the rectangle icon on the review bar. On the screen, click where you want the rectangle to start, hold and drag your cursor to draw the rectangle and then release it once you’ve enclosed the area. A comment box will appear where you can add your feedback. Add your comment and click on the green button to save it. F. Easer The eraser is used to remove/delete annotations without removing the comment associated with them. To use the eraser tool, select the eraser icon below the rectangle and click on the annotation you want to remove. If you want to remove the comment associated with the annotation, simply click the trash icon at the top right of each individual comment. This will remove the annotation as well as the comment.Note: If you have selected any annotation but haven’t added the comment yet, then pressing the “ESC” of your PC will remove it. G. Screenshot There are times when you just have to take a screenshot. This screenshot tool can be used to capture the screen you are on. There are two ways you can capture the screen. I. Visible area screenshot If you want to capture the area which is visible on your screen then click this option. It will take the shot, process it and will open a new section called screens where you will see the screenshot taken. You can then use the different annotations available to start your review right on the screenshot. II. Full page screenshot We’ve all been there. We’ve wanted to grab a fullscreen screenshot without having the proper means to do so. Now if you want to capture the full page then click this option. It will take the shot, process it and will save it in a new section where you will see the full page screenshot taken. There you can use the different annotations available to start your review right on the full screenshot. III. Record video Chances are you want to explain specific issues to a client or a team member, showing them exactly how a site performs or how you want it to perform. For this, we have a recording tool which you can use to record the screen and yourself with audio, for better context. To record the video, just select the record video option. This will open up an interface where you will find multiple recording features. Make sure the “Recordvideo” option is selected. Set the settings i.e. record microphone or audio as per your choice. Then click on “Recordvideo”. This will open up a UI from Chrome where you will be required to select the screen for recording. Select from the screen or window option and click “Share”. It will start the recording. Once the recording is done, then click on “Stopsharing”. It will process the video and will open it up in a new window where you will be able to play your recorded video and add annotations . H. Slideshow Now that we’ve provided a lot of contextual feedback and annotations, it’s time to look at it from a high-level view. The slideshow function allows you to see all of your screenshots, screen recordings and comments. You can also add annotations and comments in the slideshow view! I. Hide/Un-hide pop-ups Content with multiple collaborators is bound to have numerous valuable feedback. However, they can often impede your view of the content itself. If the comments are blocking the content on your file then you can easily hide them. Just click on “Hide” to close all the popups. Don’t worry! Your feedbacks are still there. And is just a click away from you. So, if you want all the comments back then click “Unhide” which will make them visible once again. J. Device mode At zipBoard, we recognize the importance of responsive sites. This is why you can review your content in the device type you want to review it. In this mode, you will be able to review your content in the multiple available device modes. To use it click on the “Device mode” option. You will see a dropdown on the top of your screen. Click on the drop-down and it will show you a list of all available devices that you can select to review your content. Simply selecting the device will emulate the screen in the same size as the device chosen. You can then take a screenshot/video and change the option from “Browse” to “Review”. On browse, you can scroll through the screen. Once you take the screenshot/video in the review mode, you will be able to add multiple annotations to review your file. If you want to exit from device mode, then simply click on “Cross” showing right next to the dropdown. Comment count & Reply count The other thing that you’ll see is that there is a comment counter on the right side of the screen. Displaying the total count of the comments added. These comments will however not reflect the replies to individual comments. Meaning, that if you reply to any comment, the comment counter will not change. You will instead notice a different counter for individual comments, keeping tabs on the number of replies to it. The default value is set to 1, which is the comment. We can set the content status from here as 1. Open 2. Approved 3. Rejected 4. In-progress J.Toggle disable comments we can add only annotation without comment using this option If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to reach out to us at support@zipboard.co.

For a comprehensive overview of our API and the various possibilities it opens up for you, check out our brand new API docs on https://docs.zipboard.co/ . Integration Example While there are several approaches you may take, this article gives you a high-level overview of what you can build with our API integration. An interactive demo project can be viewed at https://weathered-darkness-2854.fly.dev/ . The first step in this process is creating an API key. You can do this by following our getting started and API authentication guides Once you have your API key ready, you can now put these in a .env file to begin safely using it in your project. Please note that we do not reccomend exposing your API key in the browser through a client-side app. We reccomend that you interact with the zipBoard API exclusively through the server. You should now be able to interact with the API in your app. Perhaps you may start by fetching all the projects associated with your organization. An example request for this can be as simple as the following: const projects = await fetch( ""https://app.zipboard.co/api/v1/projects?orgid=your-org-id"", { headers: { ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"", authorization: apiKey, }, } ) You can also create projects using the API if you do not have existing projects in your organization. Once you have fetched the data associated with your organization you should be able to leverage it in your backend or display it in your UI with custom styling. To upload a file to zipBoard using the API, you can leverage the files API. Note that we currently only support URLs and hosted PDF URL uploads through the API. For any other file types you will need to upload files through our UI. The zipBoard API also gives you programmatic access to view all your uploads irrespective of file type. You can find detailed documentation for this at https://docs.zipboard.co/#tag/Files/paths/~1api~1v1~1files/get You can now bring these pieces together to initiate a content review with zipBoard. To do this, you need to make a POST request to create a review link with your project ID and the ID of the file you’d like to review. You will receive a response with a link to review your file. Navigate to the link returned in the response and you should be able to see your file with all of zipboard review tools ready for you to use. You can review PDFs and ZIP files by default without any add-ons. In order to review other files types you will need to install zipBoard’s browser extension for Chrome, Firefox or Edge.

Now, let's dive into our latest update: introducing a feature that allows you to upload and share MP3 audio files with your colleagues. While you can't add annotations directly to the MP3 files, you can utilize comments strategically to highlight specific sections of the audio. Here's the scoop: When your teammates listen to your audio, they can also read your notes plus they can add comments. Inside those little boxes, you can share valuable insights, creative ideas, and your thoughts – all to make your message crystal clear. Let your coworkers in on your plans by pinpointing which part of the audio you're eyeing for your project, or simply spicing up your assets with awesome tunes, this tool's your best friend. Consider comments as handy markers that ensure everyone's following the same rhythm when it comes to the audio content. With comments, collaboration becomes a smooth symphony of ideas and understanding. Uploading an MP3 File: Log in to your zipBoard account. Navigate to the project where you want to share the MP3 file. Click on the ""Add"" button that lets you upload files. Select the MP3 audio file you want to share from your local drive. Wait for the file to upload and become available for review. Leaving Comments: Play the uploaded MP3 file by clicking the play button.

Click on the comment tool located within the interface. Leave a comment that describes your thoughts or intention for that specific part of the audio. Tips: Use descriptive comments to ensure your coworkers understand the significance of a specific audio section. If you're using the audio for a particular purpose, mention it clearly in your comments. Collaborators can reply to your comments, making discussions smoother and more contextual. With zipBoard's MP3 File Sharing feature, you can seamlessly share audio files, leave comments for precision, and enhance your collaborative efforts.

At zipBoard, we're all about optimizing your project management experience. That's why we're excited to introduce a significant improvement to our notification system. We know that staying informed about task updates is crucial, but we also understand the frustration of being bombarded with a barrage of notifications. What's New: When multiple changes occur concerning a single task, these updates will now be bundled together within a single notification . This means you won't be flooded with individual notifications for every change, ensuring your notification feed remains clear and easy to manage. How It Works: Grouped Notifications: If several updates happen in relation to the same task, you'll see them grouped under a single notification. Dropdown Convenience: To see the detailed list of changes, simply click on the notification. A dropdown menu will reveal all the updates related to that particular task. Simplified Viewing: Instead of scrolling through numerous separate notifications, you can now review all the changes within one organized notification card. Benefits: Efficient Communication: Stay updated without being overwhelmed by individual notifications. Clutter-Free Feed: Your notification feed remains neat and concise, focusing only on important tasks. Quick Access: Access all related updates in one click, streamlining your workflow. Note: These changes apply when multiple updates are linked to a single task. Individual notifications for distinct tasks will remain unchanged. With our improved notification system, you can handle task updates more effectively, ensuring you're always in the loop without the hassle of excessive notifications. Did this answer your question?

However, managing their notifications and access can sometimes be challenging. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of handling guest reviewer notifications and access within the platform. Guest Reviewer Notifications: Email Notifications: Guest reviewers do not receive email notifications when someone replies to their comments. However, if a guest reviewer inputs their email address in the optional field, they will indeed receive email notifications for replies. Accessing Replies: Guest reviewers can revisit the shared link to view replies and comments made by clients. Even comments added as tasks and their subsequent replies will be visible on the review board. Managing Access: Deleting Shared Links: Deleting the shared link does not immediately revoke access for guest reviewers and collaborators. Even after deletion, guest reviewers and collaborators may still access the link if they have it saved or cached. Revoking Access: Deleting the guest reviewer from the collaborators tab will revoke their access, this only works if you set up a password. Upon attempting to access the link again, they will be prompted for a password (if set). To ensure complete removal, delete the shared link from the share link section as well. Permanent Removal: To prevent any further access, ensure both the guest reviewer (if applicable) and the shared link are deleted. Deleting the shared link will redirect users to app.zipboard.co upon attempting to access it again. Rest assured, removing the guest reviewer from the collaborators tab does not delete their comments; it only prevents them from receiving further notifications. Effectively managing guest reviewer notifications and access is crucial for maintaining security and control over project feedback in zipBoard.

Understanding zipBoard Functionality zipBoard empowers users to review and annotate various web content formats, including webpages, courses , PDFs , and videos . While zipBoard excels at pinpointing annotations on standard formats like PDFs and videos, its ability to precisely tag comments on webpages and courses hinges on the underlying HTML structure. Challenges with Webpages and Courses: Non-Standardized Code: Unlike standardized formats, webpages and courses often employ varying code structures depending on the authoring tool used. This inconsistency makes it difficult to universally support every authoring tool. Missing APIs: In cases where the authoring tool doesn't expose specific APIs, zipBoard is unable to achieve direct tagging functionality. Requirements for Direct Annotation in zipBoard For annotations to function directly on courses or webpages within zipBoard, the following information is essential: Unique URL per Page: Every webpage within the course must possess a unique URL to reflect any content changes. This ensures annotations stay attached to the correct content. JavaScript API for Location Tracking (Optional): Alternatively, the webpage can expose an API in the global scope, enabling zipBoard to read and set the current location within the course. This API typically takes the form of window.getPageId (to read) and window.setPageId (to set). The exact implementation may vary based on the authoring tool or webpage, but zipBoard is engineered to accommodate a wide range of variations. Unique Element IDs and Class Names: Precise annotation positioning relies heavily on elements having unique IDs and class names. If the course content changes without altering the URL or exposing the JavaScript API for location tracking, and elements lack unique IDs/class names, annotations might appear in incorrect locations. Authoring Tools Supporting Direct Annotations: The following authoring tools have been tested and confirmed to work seamlessly with zipBoard's direct annotation feature: Rise 360 (Articulate) Adobe Captivate GOMO Authoring Tools Requiring Screenshots: Courses created using the following authoring tools currently do not allow for direct tagging of annotations within zipBoard. As a workaround, users can capture screenshots and add annotations to those screenshots: Articulate Storyline 360 Elucidat Adapt Please Note: This list reflects the authoring tools tested by zipBoard. If you have a specific tool you'd like zipBoard to test for compatibility, feel free to contact zipBoard support at support@zipboard.co. Course Requirements for the zipBoard Player While zipBoard doesn't mandate specific tracking standards for courses to function within its player, there are instances where enabling these standards might be necessary for optimal course operation. If the course engine relies on any of the following standards to function properly, the zipBoard player will require them as well: SCORM 1.2 / 2004 Tin Can API Additional Support For any further inquiries or to report issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to zipBoard support at support@zipboard.co.

At zipBoard, we know getting your SCORM files reviewed quickly is important. Sometimes, however, a seemingly valid SCORM file might not launch for review right away. This is because SCORM packages don't inherently specify a starting point. What's a Start File? Think of a SCORM file as a toolbox. It contains all the pieces needed for your eLearning course, like HTML pages, images, and activities. But unlike a traditional program, there's no single ""run"" button. A start file, often named ""index.html"" or ""launch.html"", acts as that button, telling the SCORM player where to begin. Why is This Happening? There are a couple of reasons why zipBoard might not automatically detect the start file: Non-Standard Naming: Sometimes, authoring tools might use different file names for the launch file. ZipBoard is looking for common names like ""index.html"" but might miss it if it's called something else. Missing File: In rare cases, the SCORM package itself might be missing the start file entirely. Why You Might Need to Add One? Authoring tools typically include a start file by default. However, some developers might create custom SCORM packages or use older authoring tools that don't automatically include one. This can lead to confusion for zipBoard's review system. How to Continue? Don't worry, fixing this is a simple process: Click the ""Add Start File"" button. This will open a pop-up window. You'll see a list of files within your SCORM package. Look for files named ""index.html"" or ""story.html"" – these are the most likely candidates. If you see the file you need, select it. Click ""Save"". zipBoard will now use the selected file as the starting point for your review. Easy as that! Did this answer your question?

At zipBoard, we know getting your SCORM files reviewed quickly is important. Sometimes, however, a seemingly valid SCORM file might not launch for review right away. This is because SCORM packages don't inherently specify a starting point. What's a Start File? Think of a SCORM file as a toolbox. It contains all the pieces needed for your eLearning course, like HTML pages, images, and activities. But unlike a traditional program, there's no single ""run"" button. A start file, often named ""index.html"" or ""launch.html"", acts as that button, telling the SCORM player where to begin. Why is This Happening? There are a couple of reasons why zipBoard might not automatically detect the start file: Non-Standard Naming: Sometimes, authoring tools might use different file names for the launch file. ZipBoard is looking for common names like ""index.html"" but might miss it if it's called something else. Missing File: In rare cases, the SCORM package itself might be missing the start file entirely. Why You Might Need to Add One? Authoring tools typically include a start file by default. However, some developers might create custom SCORM packages or use older authoring tools that don't automatically include one. This can lead to confusion for zipBoard's review system. How to Continue? Don't worry, fixing this is a simple process: Click the ""Add Start File"" button. This will open a pop-up window. You'll see a list of files within your SCORM package. Look for files named ""index.html"" or ""story.html"" – these are the most likely candidates. If you see the file you need, select it. Click ""Save"". zipBoard will now use the selected file as the starting point for your review. Easy as that! Did this answer your question?

By managing your task types—whether adding, editing, or deleting them—you can tailor your project structure to your team’s specific needs. This guide will walk you through the steps to manage task types and maintain a streamlined workspace. Why Manage Task Types? Here are a few key reasons to actively manage task types: Prevent Duplication : Eliminate redundant task types that clutter your project. Adapt to Project Needs : Adjust task types as your project evolves. Keep Tasks Consistent : Standardize how tasks are categorized across the project for clarity. Deleting Task Types Managing task types effectively also involves knowing when and how to delete unnecessary or redundant task types. zipBoard offers flexible options for deleting task types, either in bulk or individually. 1. Bulk Deletion of Custom Task Types To delete all custom task types except for the default one: Access Task Types : From your project dashboard, go to the Task Types section. Click Bulk Actions (AI Powered) : In the task types settings, select the Bulk Actions dropdown. Choose an Option : Delete All Custom Task Types : This will remove all custom task types, keeping only the default type. Delete All Unsaved Task Types : This will remove any task types that haven’t been saved to the project. Note: If a task type already exists in the project, it won't be duplicated when custom types are added again. 2. Deleting Task Types Individually To delete a task type individually: Navigate to Task Types : In the Task Types section of your project settings, find the task type you want to delete. Click the “X” Button : Next to each custom task type, click the “X” to remove it. 3. Handling Task Types with Associated Tasks When deleting a task type that has tasks associated with it, zipBoard will prompt you to assign a new task type for those tasks. Here’s how the process works: Delete the Task Type : If the task type you are deleting has associated tasks, a pop-up will appear prompting you to select a replacement task type. Select a New Task Type : Choose a new task type from the list. Apply Changes : Once selected, all tasks associated with the deleted type will be updated to reflect the new type. Note: Task types cannot be edited. If you need to change a task type, it’s best to delete the old one and replace it with a new, updated version. Did this answer your question?

Deleting Task Types Individually To delete a task type individually: Navigate to Task Types : In the Task Types section of your project settings, find the task type you want to delete. Click the “X” Button : Next to each custom task type, click the “X” to remove it. 3. Handling Task Types with Associated Tasks When deleting a task type that has tasks associated with it, zipBoard will prompt you to assign a new task type for those tasks. Here’s how the process works: Delete the Task Type : If the task type you are deleting has associated tasks, a pop-up will appear prompting you to select a replacement task type. Select a New Task Type : Choose a new task type from the list. Apply Changes : Once selected, all tasks associated with the deleted type will be updated to reflect the new type. Note: Task types cannot be edited. If you need to change a task type, it’s best to delete the old one and replace it with a new, updated version. Did this answer your question?

However, manually adding tags can be repetitive, especially when managing multiple projects with numerous tasks. Inconsistent tagging can also make it challenging to find specific tasks and track project progress effectively. The new AI-powered auto tagging feature in zipBoard simplifies this process by automatically suggesting tags based on the task title and file name. With just a few clicks, your tasks will be organized with minimal effort—and you can fully customize the tags to suit your specific project needs. How It Works Select a Project : Start by navigating to the project where you want to add a task. Go to Tasks : In the project dashboard, locate the “Tasks” section. Add a Task : Click on “Add Task” to open the task creation window. Enter a Task Title : As you type a descriptive title, the AI will analyze both the title and any associated file name to generate relevant tagging suggestions. Apply Suggested Tags and Customize : The AI will automatically apply relevant tags to the task. If any of the suggested tags don’t align with your needs, you can easily remove them. You also have the option to add your own custom tags , giving you full control over how each task is labeled and organized. Why Use AI-Powered Autotagging? Save Time : Automate the tagging process, letting the AI handle the details so you can focus on higher-priority tasks. Stay Organized : Consistent, AI-driven tags make it easier to retrieve tasks and maintain clear organization across projects. Reduce Errors : With AI suggestions, the risk of missing or irrelevant tags is minimized, ensuring a smoother workflow and better tracking. Customize Tags to Fit Your Needs : Tailor the tags to fit your project’s specific requirements by adding, adjusting, or removing tags as necessary.

They can also define statuses at the project level (e.g., In Review , Approved , Final ) or across the organization for consistent workflows. 📌 Pro Tip : Use descriptive file names (e.g., BuildingA-Blueprint-v3.pdf ) to keep track of document versions. Step 2: Annotate and Review Open a PDF from your project dashboard. Use zipBoard’s annotation tools to: Mark issues directly on the blueprint. Add comments to highlight questions, approvals, or corrections. Assign tasks to team members for follow-up. 📌 Example : Highlight an outdated window spec on a blueprint and comment, ""Please confirm updated dimensions.""

Additionally, manage your own comments by editing or deleting them as needed to keep feedback organized. Step 3: Version Control Upload new versions of documents to maintain a clean workflow. 📌 Pro Tip : Always upload the most recent version to ensure the team works on accurate data. Step 4: Collaborate with Your Team Share the document link with stakeholders via share link! Allow external collaborators (e.g., contractors) to review and comment without requiring a zipBoard account. Set access permissions to control who can view or edit specific files. Step 5: How to Track and Prioritize Feedback from Guests in zipBoard Once feedback starts coming in from collaborators and stakeholders, project managers need to triage and organize it effectively. Triage Feedback : Sort incoming comments based on their relevance, urgency, and impact on the project. Prioritize Actionable Feedback : Focus on addressing feedback that aligns with the project goals and objectives. Learn more about tracking and prioritizing feedback here . Step 6: Generate Reports Use zipBoard’s reporting tools to compile feedback and unresolved tasks into a shareable report. Share reports during construction meetings to prioritize action items.

This guide helps you navigate zipBoard’s features tailored to learning design workflows. Step 1: Set Up Your Project Log in to zipBoard and click "" Create a New Project. "" Name your project or specify the type of learning materials you’ll review (e.g., SCORM Modules, Training Videos, PDF Guides). Set statuses at the project level (e.g., Draft, Review, Final) to reflect your workflow. 📌 Pro Tip : Organize your project into phases , such as Storyboard Review, SCORM Testing, and Video Feedback. Step 2: Upload Learning Materials Navigate to your project dashboard and click ""Add Files."" Upload SCORM packages, video files, or PDFs. For SCORM content , zipBoard can host and preview the content directly. Categorize files into phases (e.g., Module 1, Assessments) to streamline navigation. 📌 Example : Upload a PDF guide for Module 1 and categorize it under Learner Handouts. Step 3: Annotate and Review Content Open any uploaded file (e.g., a SCORM module, video, or PDF). Use annotation tools to: Mark issues or suggest edits directly on the file. Add timestamps on videos for precise feedback. Highlight text in PDFs to point out errors or suggest revisions. Reply to comments, accept/reject feedback, and mark annotations as Resolved or Cancelled . 📌 Pro Tip : Use zipBoard's comment threads to collaborate in real time with stakeholders. Step 4: Track SCORM Package Testing Preview SCORM content directly in zipBoard to test navigation, interactivity, and completion tracking. Report any bugs or inconsistencies by creating tasks linked to specific slides or elements. 📌 Example : If a quiz question in a SCORM package doesn’t load, highlight the issue and tag the developer to fix it. Step 5: Share Learning Materials with Stakeholders From the project dashboard, select the SCORM package, video, or PDF you want to share. Click ""Share Link"" and customize permissions: Viewer Only : Allow collaborators to view the material without editing or commenting. Commenter : Enable reviewers to add annotations or comments. Share the link with stakeholders via email or integrate it into platforms like Microsoft Teams or Slack. 📌 Pro Tip : Use zipBoard’s guest access feature to involve external reviewers (e.g., SMEs or clients) without requiring them to create an account. Step 6: Track and Prioritize Feedback Once feedback starts coming in, it’s essential to organize and act on it: Triage feedback based on its urgency, relevance, and impact on learner outcomes. Prioritize actionable feedback that aligns with project goals. Learn more about tracking and prioritizing feedback here . Step 7: Manage Versions and Updates Upload updated versions of SCORM files, videos, or PDFs as feedback is implemented. Step 8: Generate Reports Use zipBoard’s reporting tools to compile feedback and unresolved tasks into a shareable report. Share reports during construction meetings to prioritize action items.

This feature helps you streamline workflows, improve security, and ensure seamless collaboration across projects. With the new Access Tab , you can easily grant, modify, or revoke client permissions—without disrupting internal collaboration. ⚠️ Client sharing is only available in the Enterprise plan ⚠️ 🔑 Key Benefits of Enhanced Client Sharing Keep Discussions Separate: Control which comments clients see while keeping internal discussions private. Adjust Client Access in Real Time: Grant, adjust, or revoke permissions as needed throughout the project. Streamline Feedback & Prioritization: Organize external feedback separately to reduce confusion and prioritize changes. Enhance Stakeholder Communication: Ensure the right people see updates, minimizing miscommunication and focusing on high-priority tasks. ❓How to Use the New Access Control Features The Client tab in the Share File modal has been transformed into a new Access tab for better usability. This update includes: Step 1: Open the Share File Modal Navigate to the file you wish to share and click the Share button. Step 2: Select Clients In the Client tab, choose the clients you want to share the file with. Existing clients will appear with their current permissions pre-selected. Step 3: Set Access Permissions Use the dropdown under the Access tab to select one of the following options: All Comments : Default setting where all Collaborator, Client, and Guest Reviewer comments are visible. Only External Comments : Restricts visibility to Client and Guest Reviewer comments only. Remove Access : Removes a client’s ability to view a previously shared file. Step 4: Save Changes Click Share to save your changes. Feedback messages will confirm the success or highlight any errors. Error and Success Messages To improve transparency, zipBoard now displays real-time notifications when adjusting client permissions. Error Messages: 🔴 No new client selected – You must select at least one new client before sharing. 🔴 All selected clients already have access – Clients already assigned cannot be reassigned. Success Messages: 🟢 File successfully shared with client. 🟢 Client can now view all comments. 🟢 Client can now view only external comments. 🔴 Client no longer has access to the file. Integration with Reviewboard Permissions set in the Share modal directly link to the Reviewboard, ensuring seamless client access: Clients with "" Only External Comments "" access can see replies on external comment threads. Clients with "" All Comments "" access can view all replies, including internal and external threads. Implementation Workflow Access Dropdown : Existing clients will have the option to ""Remove Access"" directly from the dropdown. Error Prevention : The ""Remove Access"" option is hidden for users who haven’t been assigned the file yet. Review Tracking Linkage : Unassigning clients in the main file modal will automatically reflect in the Client Share modal, ensuring consistency. How Different Teams Use Client Share Files AEC Teams : Securely share blueprints, revisions, and construction documents while controlling client access to sensitive data. eLearning Teams : Share course materials, training modules, and assessments with clients and stakeholders , ensuring they only have access to relevant content. Web Design Teams : Easily collaborate with clients by sharing design mockups and prototypes, enabling real-time feedback.

This feature helps you streamline workflows, improve security, and ensure seamless collaboration across projects. With the new Access Tab , you can easily grant, modify, or revoke client permissions—without disrupting internal collaboration. ⚠️ Client sharing is only available in the Enterprise plan ⚠️ 🔑 Key Benefits of Enhanced Client Sharing Keep Discussions Separate: Control which comments clients see while keeping internal discussions private. Adjust Client Access in Real Time: Grant, adjust, or revoke permissions as needed throughout the project. Streamline Feedback & Prioritization: Organize external feedback separately to reduce confusion and prioritize changes. Enhance Stakeholder Communication: Ensure the right people see updates, minimizing miscommunication and focusing on high-priority tasks. ❓How to Use the New Access Control Features The Client tab in the Share File modal has been transformed into a new Access tab for better usability. This update includes: Step 1: Open the Share File Modal Navigate to the file you wish to share and click the Share button. Step 2: Select Clients In the Client tab, choose the clients you want to share the file with. Existing clients will appear with their current permissions pre-selected. Step 3: Set Access Permissions Use the dropdown under the Access tab to select one of the following options: All Comments : Default setting where all Collaborator, Client, and Guest Reviewer comments are visible. Only External Comments : Restricts visibility to Client and Guest Reviewer comments only. Remove Access : Removes a client’s ability to view a previously shared file. Step 4: Save Changes Click Share to save your changes. Feedback messages will confirm the success or highlight any errors. Error and Success Messages To improve transparency, zipBoard now displays real-time notifications when adjusting client permissions. Error Messages: 🔴 No new client selected – You must select at least one new client before sharing. 🔴 All selected clients already have access – Clients already assigned cannot be reassigned. Success Messages: 🟢 File successfully shared with client. 🟢 Client can now view all comments. 🟢 Client can now view only external comments. 🔴 Client no longer has access to the file. Integration with Reviewboard Permissions set in the Share modal directly link to the Reviewboard, ensuring seamless client access: Clients with "" Only External Comments "" access can see replies on external comment threads. Clients with "" All Comments "" access can view all replies, including internal and external threads. Implementation Workflow Access Dropdown : Existing clients will have the option to ""Remove Access"" directly from the dropdown. Error Prevention : The ""Remove Access"" option is hidden for users who haven’t been assigned the file yet. Review Tracking Linkage : Unassigning clients in the main file modal will automatically reflect in the Client Share modal, ensuring consistency. How Different Teams Use Client Share Files AEC Teams : Securely share blueprints, revisions, and construction documents while controlling client access to sensitive data. eLearning Teams : Share course materials, training modules, and assessments with clients and stakeholders , ensuring they only have access to relevant content. Web Design Teams : Easily collaborate with clients by sharing design mockups and prototypes, enabling real-time feedback. Teams Using Markup Tools: Share annotated documents and designs, ensuring feedback is precise and actionable.

Disorganized feedback, version control issues, and delayed approvals often slow down production and impact deadlines. zipBoard’s Content Development Template simplifies content review workflows by providing a structured process for gathering feedback, tracking revisions, and managing approvals. With predefined phases and statuses, your team can enhance collaboration, reduce miscommunication, and ensure high-quality content delivery. Common Content Development Challenges & How This Template Helps: Issue: Feedback is scattered across multiple platforms → Solution: Centralized comments & task tracking. Issue: Version control is confusing → Solution: A structured approval process with clear revision history. Issue: Long review cycles delay publication → Solution: Defined workflow stages for smoother approvals. Phases Organize content creation into logical steps to streamline collaboration and improve quality assurance. Key Phases & What Happens in Each Stage: Research & Discovery (Default): Audience insights, content goals, project requirements. Draft Development: Initial content creation, structure planning, first iteration. Technical Validation: Accuracy checks, compliance review, fact verification. Editing & Refinement: Clarity improvements, tone adjustments, consistency checks. Stakeholder Review: SME feedback, client input, team evaluations. Final Production: Final adjustments, formatting, distribution preparation. 💡 Even with pre-configured Phases, you have options to customize them to suit your specific content development workflow. Task Types Ensure all team members know their responsibilities and deadlines with structured task management. Task Types & When to Use Them: White Paper (Default): Publish in-depth reports on industry trends, research, or solutions. API Documentation: Standardize technical guides for developers to integrate systems. Release Notes: Summarize software updates, new features, and bug fixes. Technical Manual: Provide step-by-step instructions for product usage and troubleshooting. Knowledge Base: Centralize FAQs, guides, and support documentation for users.

Statuses Stay updated on content production at every stage, from ideation to final publication, with a structured document approval process template. What Do These Statuses Mean in a Content Development Project? Planning (Default): Define content objectives, scope, and key deliverables. Draft: Initial content creation phase before any review process. Peer Review: Internal review by team members to refine accuracy and structure. Technical Review: Verification of technical accuracy by subject matter experts. Editing Phase: Final content polishing for grammar, tone, and formatting. 💡 Even with pre-configured Project Statuses, you have options to customize to suit your specific workflows. Views Access different views to organize content, track revisions, and streamline collaboration. How Different Roles Use These Views: Content Creators: Use Kanban View to manage content progress from draft to publication. Project Managers: Use Table View to track content statuses, review cycles, and deadlines. Reviewers & Editors: Use Task & Upload Views to centralize files, revisions, and feedback.

With zipBoard’s annotation focus feature , you no longer need to shuffle between documents or waste time scrolling. Now you can: View all comments in one central task list , across multiple PDFs. Search, filter, and prioritize feedback without opening each file. And when you’re ready, launch the PDF to see the annotation exactly where it belongs — with all surrounding context. What’s New Centralized review workflow – Navigate issues from the task list directly into the right spot in the PDF. Precision focus – Each task carries a unique URL parameter, ensuring the correct annotation is highlighted every time. Cross-browser reliability – Works smoothly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Multi-tab safe – No data conflicts, even if you’re reviewing multiple PDFs at once. How It Works Create an annotation in the PDF Review Board. A linked task appears in your project’s task list — searchable and filterable . From that task, click Review / View Annotation . The PDF Review Board opens and highlights the exact annotation, with all nearby context visible. Why It Matters In traditional PDF review tools, you’re forced to open each document to hunt for the right comment. With zipBoard, you manage comments in one place — like a dashboard for your reviews. This makes it easy to search, filter, and assign tasks, and then instantly jump into the document view only when you need the full context. The new URL-based focus parameter makes that jump seamless and reliable. No more losing track of which annotation you were supposed to review. Who Benefits Most AEC & Construction – Track markups across multiple blueprints, then open the exact section in a single click. Quickly resolve RFIs or submittals without losing time hunting comments. Creative Agencies – Manage client change requests across campaigns, without opening each PDF individually. Education & Training – Collect comments on course materials in one list, then drill down into specific slides or sections. Jump into the right slide/page of a long PDF course draft for faster reviews. Experience the New Workflow Request a Demo to see centralized comment management + annotation focusing in action.

With zipBoard’s annotation focus feature , you no longer need to shuffle between documents or waste time scrolling. Now you can: View all comments in one central task list , across multiple PDFs. Search, filter, and prioritize feedback without opening each file. And when you’re ready, launch the PDF to see the annotation exactly where it belongs — with all surrounding context. What’s New Centralized review workflow – Navigate issues from the task list directly into the right spot in the PDF. Precision focus – Each task carries a unique URL parameter, ensuring the correct annotation is highlighted every time. Cross-browser reliability – Works smoothly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Multi-tab safe – No data conflicts, even if you’re reviewing multiple PDFs at once. How It Works Create an annotation in the PDF Review Board. A linked task appears in your project’s task list — searchable and filterable . From that task, click Review / View Annotation . The PDF Review Board opens and highlights the exact annotation, with all nearby context visible. Why It Matters In traditional PDF review tools, you’re forced to open each document to hunt for the right comment. With zipBoard, you manage comments in one place — like a dashboard for your reviews. This makes it easy to search, filter, and assign tasks, and then instantly jump into the document view only when you need the full context. The new URL-based focus parameter makes that jump seamless and reliable. No more losing track of which annotation you were supposed to review. Who Benefits Most AEC & Construction – Track markups across multiple blueprints, then open the exact section in a single click. Quickly resolve RFIs or submittals without losing time hunting comments. Creative Agencies – Manage client change requests across campaigns, without opening each PDF individually. Education & Training – Collect comments on course materials in one list, then drill down into specific slides or sections. Jump into the right slide/page of a long PDF course draft for faster reviews. Experience the New Workflow Request a Demo to see centralized comment management + annotation focusing in action. Or start your 14-day Free Trial and streamline your PDF reviews. Check our Release Notes for the latest updates. Explore More Guides: Can I Annotate Content Without Using the Extension?

A common concern is whether deleting a template will affect active projects. Answer Deleting a template does not impact projects that were already created using it. Existing projects remain safe and unchanged. The template is simply removed from the library for future use. Example Template A is used to create Project 1 and Project 2. You delete Template A. Project 1 and Project 2 continue to function normally. Template A is no longer available for creating new projects. Best Practice Before deleting a template, check if it’s still relevant for future projects. Did this answer your question? Thanks for the feedback There was a problem submitting your feedback.

Annotation behavior and task creation rules differ for other asset types such as websites, images, videos, or SCORM content. Understanding the Basics Before diving deeper into PDF annotations, it is helpful to understand these few keywords: What is an Annotation? An annotation is a visual mark, comment, or highlight placed directly onto a document. Think of it as a ""digital sticky note"" used to point out specific areas that need attention. What is a Task? A task is an actionable work item. Unlike a simple comment, a task can be assigned to a team member, given a deadline, tracked through a status (such as ""Open"" or ""Resolved""), and organized in your project’s Kanban board or list. What is a PDF Annotation? Specifically for PDF files, annotations allow you to interact with the static layers of the document, marking up text, circling layout issues, or pointing to specific images within the PDF. Turn Feedback into Action Automatically In zipBoard, certain PDF annotations automatically trigger a task. This bridge allows you to mark a mistake and turn it into a work item for your team in one single motion. In the zipBoard PDF viewer, specific annotation tools are designed to do more than just mark up a document, they automatically generate a Task . This allows you to turn feedback into actionable items the moment you identify a change, without extra steps. Which PDF Annotations Create Tasks? Use the table below to see which tools trigger task creation and which are for visual reference only. Category Tool Creates a Task Markups Highlight, Underline, Strikeout, Squiggly, Note ✅ Yes Shapes Rectangle, Ellipse, Arc, Polygon, Cloud ✅ Yes Lines Line, Polyline, Arrow ✅ Yes Free Hand Free Hand, Free Hand Highlight ✅ Yes Text Free Text ❌ No Inserts Signature, Rubber Stamp, Image ❌ No Fill & Sign Checkmarks, Dots, Crosses, Signatures ❌ No How it Works Select an Annotation Tool : Choose any tool in the annotate and shapes tool bar. Mark the Document: Apply the annotation to the specific area of the PDF. Click Save Task Generation : As soon as the annotation is placed, a task panel opens where you can: Assign an owner Set priority Add context or instructions No extra clicks. No manual task creation. When to Use Visual-Only Annotations Some feedback doesn’t need to be tracked as work. Use non-task annotations when you want to: Visual-Only Feedback: Use Free Text or Stamps if you want to leave a permanent label or label on the page without cluttering your task list. Precision: Use the Arrow or Rectangle tools for specific UI/layout feedback to ensure the task is clearly linked to the correct PDF element. Form Filling: Please note that Fill and Sign tools (like Ticks and Dots) are intended for document completion and do not create tracked tasks. Looking for task creation rules for other content types? Read more guides on PDF Document here: How to Review and Get Feedback on PDF Documents PDF Annotation Tools Overview How to Add / Upload PDF File Annotation behavior varies by asset type. Refer to these relevant guides for websites, images, or learning content. How do I share my website, PDF file, HTML / SCORM file, images or video for commenting?

Annotation behavior and task creation rules differ for other asset types such as websites, images, videos, or SCORM content. Understanding the Basics Before diving deeper into PDF annotations, it is helpful to understand these few keywords: What is an Annotation? An annotation is a visual mark, comment, or highlight placed directly onto a document. Think of it as a ""digital sticky note"" used to point out specific areas that need attention. What is a Task? A task is an actionable work item. Unlike a simple comment, a task can be assigned to a team member, given a deadline, tracked through a status (such as ""Open"" or ""Resolved""), and organized in your project’s Kanban board or list. What is a PDF Annotation? Specifically for PDF files, annotations allow you to interact with the static layers of the document, marking up text, circling layout issues, or pointing to specific images within the PDF. Turn Feedback into Action Automatically In zipBoard, certain PDF annotations automatically trigger a task. This bridge allows you to mark a mistake and turn it into a work item for your team in one single motion. In the zipBoard PDF viewer, specific annotation tools are designed to do more than just mark up a document, they automatically generate a Task . This allows you to turn feedback into actionable items the moment you identify a change, without extra steps. Which PDF Annotations Create Tasks? Use the table below to see which tools trigger task creation and which are for visual reference only. Category Tool Creates a Task Markups Highlight, Underline, Strikeout, Squiggly, Note ✅ Yes Shapes Rectangle, Ellipse, Arc, Polygon, Cloud ✅ Yes Lines Line, Polyline, Arrow ✅ Yes Free Hand Free Hand, Free Hand Highlight ✅ Yes Text Free Text ❌ No Inserts Signature, Rubber Stamp, Image ❌ No Fill & Sign Checkmarks, Dots, Crosses, Signatures ❌ No How it Works Select an Annotation Tool : Choose any tool in the annotate and shapes tool bar. Mark the Document: Apply the annotation to the specific area of the PDF. Click Save Task Generation : As soon as the annotation is placed, a task panel opens where you can: Assign an owner Set priority Add context or instructions No extra clicks. No manual task creation. When to Use Visual-Only Annotations Some feedback doesn’t need to be tracked as work. Use non-task annotations when you want to: Visual-Only Feedback: Use Free Text or Stamps if you want to leave a permanent label or label on the page without cluttering your task list. Precision: Use the Arrow or Rectangle tools for specific UI/layout feedback to ensure the task is clearly linked to the correct PDF element. Form Filling: Please note that Fill and Sign tools (like Ticks and Dots) are intended for document completion and do not create tracked tasks. Looking for task creation rules for other content types? Read more guides on PDF Document here: How to Review and Get Feedback on PDF Documents PDF Annotation Tools Overview How to Add / Upload PDF File Annotation behavior varies by asset type. Refer to these relevant guides for websites, images, or learning content. How do I share my website, PDF file, HTML / SCORM file, images or video for commenting?
